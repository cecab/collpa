Axcel-G
=======
Some pieces of Clojure Code to glue Axel-F with Google Sheets. [Kill Chernyshov](https://twitter.com/DeLaGuardo/status/1063002155819458560), developer of Axel-F, twitted the slides of his presentation in Clojure Meetup Berlin, as he explains, Axel-F is about: "give the fun and power of Clojure to non-programmers", but one of the things that would make easier for non-programmers is to work on real spreadsheets, like Google Sheets, that is the aim of this project.

Axcel-G is a a template application, it gives you the basic peaces and the instructions to start working fully interactive (like REPL) over Google Sheets and Clojure
